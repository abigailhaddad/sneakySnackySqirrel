# sneakySnackySquirrel

The goals of this are to:
-model the results of sneaky snacky squirrel:
  first player advantage?
  average number of turns to end/how this varies with # of players
  evaluate strategies for stealing and/or picking colors
  
 -make game playable with combination of human and computer players
 
 7/9/21 implemented: 
 
 -game runs, but no human players
 -can evalute first player advantage and average # of turns to end
 -prints what's going on - the spin result and which players gained or lost which colors
 
 7/12/21 implemented:
 
 -runs with people
 -people make choices about what to take/steal
 -prints options for taking/stealing, but not in the most human-readable way
 -there is error handling but it's opaque to the player
 
 next - helpful messages to humans about what to enter // make it seem more interactive even for normal turns (maybe make them SPIN)
